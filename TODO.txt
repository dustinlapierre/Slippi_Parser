structures for player data to clean up code and remove magic numbers
shield pressure (add attack state check)

main commentary:
    -crossups? (LSTM potential)
support commentary:
    -average percentage per stock
character commentary:
    -wobble check
    -knee or falcon punch check
    -peach stitch check, if carrying an item and item is stitch? If not maybe a dsmash check and make a blender joke.

REFACTORING:
major:
    *structures for player data to clean up code and remove magic numbers
    *make the main structures global and remove them as parameters in everything

minor:
    *move parse functions into structures file
    *hex to int and int to hex conversion moved to another file along with all the parse functions
    *move LSTM update to the LSTM file
